# Solution
after i opened the text file it appear that the file contain alot of whitespaces so i thought that maybe it coded in whitespace language when i searched for an interpreter on the net

![code](code.png)

nothiing appeared after some research i foudn that, there a tool called stegsnow that hide data using whitespace after i used it
`stegsnow -C flag_.txt`
this for arch users install the tar.gz file and put this
`$ snow -C flag_.txt`
i found the flag
Flag: `microCTF{ch0up1_m4$t3ry_4p4r3c1um}`
